# How to merge core extension changes to your app overrides

The repository has the following structure

```
.
+-- README.md
+-- core/
    +-- lib/
        +-- myfile.txt
+-- app/
    +-- lib/
        +-- myfile.txt
```

The app and core libraries are identical, as if the app override was just created.

Once changes have been made to the code, we do the following:

## Create a temporary branch consisting of only the core library

```shell
git checkout -b tmp-branch
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter core/lib
git checkout master
```
## Merge the temporary branch into the app directory and delete temporary branch

```shell
git merge -X subtree=app/lib --squash tmp-branch --allow-unrelated-histories
git branch -D tmp-branch
```

**NOTES**

 * The `--squash` command is used to avoid duplicate commits in the tree (one from core and one from the merge into app)
 * The `--allow-unrelated-histories` is necessary for this to work
 * This keeps the main tree really clean!  All you will see is one commit for the core -> app merge.
